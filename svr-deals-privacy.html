<h1>SVR Deals Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 11, 2025<br>
<strong>App Name:</strong> SVR Deals – Black Friday App<br>
<strong>Developer:</strong> Aishwarya Creative Films LLC<br>
<strong>Contact:</strong> <a href="mailto:admin@aishwaryacreativefilms.com">admin@aishwaryacreativefilms.com</a></p>

<p>SVR Deals is designed to surface trustworthy shopping intelligence with a privacy-forward foundation. The app does not require a user account or sign-up and focuses on collecting the minimum data necessary to deliver analytics, optimization, and feedback loops.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>We collect the following limited data points whenever you interact with the app or our upcoming web companion:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>IP Address:</strong> Stored in short-term logs to keep our systems secure, prevent fraud, and understand regional performance trends.</li>
  <li><strong>Device and App Diagnostics:</strong> Basic device type, OS version, crash reports, and anonymized identifiers that help us troubleshoot bugs.</li>
  <li><strong>Engagement Analytics:</strong> Aggregated event data (e.g., when a user taps “Save Deal” or opens a push notification) so we can prioritize the most helpful features.</li>
  <li><strong>In-App Feedback:</strong> Optional comments or ratings submitted through the “Share Feedback” form. These submissions are stored in encrypted workspaces and reviewed only by the SVR Deals product team.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. How We Use the Data</h2>
<p>Each data type above serves a specific purpose:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> Understanding which deal categories resonate most allows us to improve the curation and reduce noise.</li>
  <li><strong>Optimizations:</strong> Diagnostics ensure the app performs on a wide range of devices and connection speeds.</li>
  <li><strong>Feedback Loops:</strong> Qualitative comments help us tweak alert timing, copywriting, and accessibility features.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not sell your data, build advertising profiles, or combine the above information with personally identifiable records.</p>

<h2>3. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
<p>Because SVR Deals does not use accounts or logins, we intentionally avoid collecting:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Names, email addresses, or phone numbers.</li>
  <li>Precise location data.</li>
  <li>Payment card details.</li>
  <li>Contact lists or photo libraries.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any optional information (for example, if you email us for support) is governed by the communication channel you choose and is not required to use the app.</p>

<h2>4. Third-Party Integrations</h2>
<p>SVR Deals partners with a small set of trusted vendors to power analytics and advertising:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Analytics Providers:</strong> Services such as Statsig or Firebase may receive aggregated usage data and IP addresses to help us understand performance patterns.</li>
  <li><strong>Advertising &amp; Affiliate Networks:</strong> When ads are displayed, participating networks may collect device identifiers or contextual information in accordance with their own privacy policies. We surface App Tracking Transparency prompts and clearly label sponsored placements.</li>
</ul>
<p>We require each partner to support privacy-forward settings, honor opt-outs, and process only the minimal data needed for their service.</p>

<h2>5. Transparency &amp; Control</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You can reset analytics identifiers by reinstalling the app or clearing data on your device.</li>
  <li>You may disable personalized ads through the device settings for iOS or Android at any time.</li>
  <li>The in-app privacy hub will show which third-party SDKs are active and provide direct links to their policies.</li>
  <li>To request deletion of feedback you submitted, email us with the approximate submission date so we can locate the entry.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>SVR Deals is built for adult shoppers and is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children. If a guardian believes a child has interacted with the app, please contact us and we will promptly remove the related data from our logs.</p>

<h2>7. Data Security &amp; Retention</h2>
<p>We store analytics events and IP logs in encrypted infrastructure managed by reputable cloud providers. Diagnostic and analytics data is retained for up to 12 months before being aggregated or deleted, unless a longer period is required for fraud prevention or legal compliance.</p>

<h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We will update this page if we introduce new features, partners, or data flows. Significant updates will be announced through the app, on our website, or via release notes so you always know what has changed.</p>

<h2>9. Contact</h2>
<p>Questions about privacy, data requests, or partnership discussions can be directed to <a href="mailto:admin@aishwaryacreativefilms.com">admin@aishwaryacreativefilms.com</a>. We aim to respond to every inquiry within 5 business days.</p>

<p>Thank you for trusting SVR Deals with your shopping adventures. Our goal is to deliver fast access to the best deals while honoring your privacy every step of the way.</p>
